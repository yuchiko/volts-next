This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project for Volts

## Prerequisites

- yarn >=1.22
- node v16.14.2
- nvm or fnm

## Getting Started

``` bash
# using nvm install and use proper node version from .nvmrc
$ nvm install
$ nvm use

# install dependencies from yarn.lock
$ yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
